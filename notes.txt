Notes about the .cme files

Looks like these files have multiple stages of encryption.
After decrypting the whole file using the "1234ghji45%3245?)(2!" key, the file had visible patterns, but no visible data, like level name, description, etc.
One thing i noticed when comparing different files, is that the first few bytes are exactly the same... but "ceasar cypher" shifted by different value.

After many attempts of shifting all the bytes in the file, i discovered that with shift of 201 (+) to each byte, we can see the level description and score value.
We can also see a familiar "30%&g/2ANUBIS=!s?p$" (without the 9 at the start) key embedded inside the file as well at position 0xD2 (every file has this key at the exact same position in the file).

TODO figure this thing out
